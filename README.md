# About the «DarkTheme»

This was my first theme contribution back in 2010 when qooxdoo 1.x was state of the art. At that time you had to use quite a number of graphical items in order to produce some kind of spatial impression in your GUI. Especially with a slow internet connection you'll find that initial rendering of many GUI elements in a «DarkTheme» application is noticeably delayed. But the longer the app is running, the less latency occurs ;-)

The «DarkTheme» you are currently looking at is not only a port to qooxdoo 3.0+, but it's also been slightly refurbished. This means that some widgets (CheckBox, RadioButton, Slider, TabView, Window) now come with "modernized" decorators, the general look & feel of the theme, however, should have been preserved.
